Models overview
The OpenAI API is powered by a diverse set of models with different capabilities and price points. You can also make customizations to our models for your specific use case with fine-tuning.

MODEL	DESCRIPTION
GPT-4o	Our high-intelligence flagship model for complex, multi-step tasks
GPT-4o mini	Our affordable and intelligent small model for fast, lightweight tasks
GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4	The previous set of high-intelligence models
GPT-3.5 Turbo	A fast, inexpensive model for simple tasks
DALL·E	A model that can generate and edit images given a natural language prompt
TTS	A set of models that can convert text into natural sounding spoken audio
Whisper	A model that can convert audio into text
Embeddings	A set of models that can convert text into a numerical form
Moderation	A fine-tuned model that can detect whether text may be sensitive or unsafe
GPT base	A set of models without instruction following that can understand as well as generate natural language or code
Deprecated	A full list of models that have been deprecated along with the suggested replacement
We have also published open source models including Point-E, Whisper, Jukebox, and CLIP.

Continuous model upgrades
gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4, and gpt-3.5-turbo point to their respective latest model version. You can verify this by looking at the response object after sending a request. The response will include the specific model version used (e.g. gpt-3.5-turbo-1106).

We also offer pinned model versions that developers can continue using for at least three months after an updated model has been introduced. With the new cadence of model updates, we are also giving people the ability to contribute evals to help us improve the model for different use cases. If you are interested, check out the OpenAI Evals repository.

GPT-4o
GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”) is our most advanced model. It is multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text), and it has the same high intelligence as GPT-4 Turbo but is much more efficient—it generates text 2x faster and is 50% cheaper. Additionally, GPT-4o has the best vision and performance across non-English languages of any of our models. GPT-4o is available in the OpenAI API to paying customers. Learn how to use GPT-4o in our text generation guide.

MODEL	DESCRIPTION	CONTEXT WINDOW	TRAINING DATA
gpt-4o	GPT-4o
Our high-intelligence flagship model for complex, multi-step tasks. GPT-4o is cheaper and faster than GPT-4 Turbo. Currently points to gpt-4o-2024-05-13.	128,000 tokens	Up to Oct 2023
gpt-4o-2024-05-13	gpt-4o currently points to this version.	128,000 tokens	Up to Oct 2023
GPT-4o mini
GPT-4o mini (“o” for “omni”) is our most advanced model in the small models category, and our cheapest model yet. It is multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text), has higher intelligence than gpt-3.5-turbo but is just as fast. It is meant to be used for smaller tasks, including vision tasks.

We recommend choosing gpt-4o-mini where you would have previously used gpt-3.5-turbo as this model is more capable and cheaper.

MODEL	DESCRIPTION	CONTEXT WINDOW	TRAINING DATA
gpt-4o-mini	New GPT-4o-mini
Our affordable and intelligent small model for fast, lightweight tasks. GPT-4o mini is cheaper and more capable than GPT-3.5 Turbo. Currently points to gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18.	128,000 tokens	Up to Oct 2023
gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18	gpt-4o-mini currently points to this version.	128,000 tokens	Up to Oct 2023
